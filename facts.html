        <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 234, 0);">Why is yeast crucial for making bread?</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/c/fb4e3e34-8661-42e0-92a5-412c306d457a">Chatgpt,</a></p>
        <h6>Answer:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li bold><strong>Fermentation</strong></li>
            <p>
                Yeast is a type of fungus that undergoes fermentation.
                During fermentation, yeast consumes sugars present in the dough and produces carbon dioxide gas and
                alcohol as byproducts.
                The carbon dioxide gas gets trapped in the dough, causing it to rise and become light and airy.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li bold><strong>Leavening</strong></li>
            <p>
                The carbon dioxide produced by yeast serves as a leavening agent.
                Leavening is the process of introducing gas into the dough to make it rise and increase in volume.
                This results in a lighter and softer texture in the finished bread.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li bold><strong>Texture and Structure</strong></li>
            <p>
                The carbon dioxide gas produced by yeast creates small bubbles throughout the dough, which contribute to
                the texture and structure of the bread.
                This process is what gives bread its characteristic airy and soft crumb.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li bold><strong>Flavour Development</strong></li>
            <p>
                Yeast also contributes to the development of the bread's flavor.
                The fermentation process produces organic acids and other flavor compounds that add complexity and depth
                to the taste of the bread.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li bold><strong>Dough Development</strong></li>
            <p>
                Yeast contributes to the development of the dough by interacting with gluten proteins.
                Gluten is a network of proteins that provides structure to the dough.
                The carbon dioxide produced by yeast helps to stretch and expand the gluten network, allowing the dough
                to rise properly.

        <h3 style="color: green;">What is the difference between bleached flour and unbleached flour?</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/c/3adaaaf8-b698-4822-b4c8-9e953bc6a41c">Chatgpt,</a></p>
        <ol>
            <li bold><strong>Bleaching Process</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li bold><strong>Bleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    This type of flour undergoes a bleaching process using chemicals like benzoyl peroxide or chlorine
                    dioxide.
                    This process helps speed up the aging or maturing of the flour, which would otherwise occur
                    naturally over time.
                    The bleaching also lightens the color of the flour, making it appear whiter.
                </p>
                <li bold><strong>Unbleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Unbleached flour, on the other hand, does not go through a chemical bleaching process.
                    Instead, it matures and whitens naturally as it ages over time.
                    This aging process can take longer than the bleaching process.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <li bold><strong>Texture and Colour</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li bold><strong>Bleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Bleached flour typically has a finer texture and a softer consistency.
                    It also tends to have a lighter color compared to unbleached flour.
                </p>
                <li bold><strong>Unbleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Unbleached flour may have a slightly denser texture and a creamier color.
                    It retains more of its natural color and may have a more robust flavor compared to bleached flour.
                </p>

            <ul>
                <li bold><strong>Bleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Due to its finer texture and softer consistency, bleached flour often produces lighter and softer
                    baked goods.
                    It is sometimes preferred in recipes where a delicate texture is desired, such as in cakes and
                    pastries.
                </p>
                <li bold><strong>Unbleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Unbleached flour is considered more versatile and is often preferred in recipes where a heartier
                    texture is desired, such as in bread and some rustic baked goods.
                    It may also have a slightly nuttier flavor.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <li bold><strong>Chemical Residues</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li bold><strong>Bleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Concerns have been raised about potential residues of the bleaching agents in bleached flour.
                    However, regulatory bodies set limits to ensure that these residues are within safe levels for
                    consumption.
                </p>
                <li bold><strong>Unbleached Flour:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Since unbleached flour does not undergo a bleaching process using chemicals, it does not have the
                    potential issue of chemical residues associated with bleached flour.
